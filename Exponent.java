/**************************************************************
 Purpose/Description: This program is designed compute a number raised to another number in a sublinear time complexity.
 In order to achieve this we must cut the program in half in constant time. In order to this we can define that:
 X^N = X^(N/2) * X^(N/2). This allows us to greatly cut down the processing time and solve the problem in a recursive manner.
 splitting the exponent in 2 can be done in constant time and to save processing resources we can store the result of
 X^(N/2) into a temporary variable to prevent doing the same operation twice. This allows is to bring down the number of
 multiplications done from 63 to only 12 in the case of X^63. which is < (N/2)/2.

     * variable we can effectively split the computational complexity by half, this is because splitting the exponent in
     * 2 can be done in O(c) or O(1) complexity. To take into account the exponent being an odd number, we can check if
